                            <p>
                                Meetings are held at the University of Delaware Newark Campus. Dates, times, and locations are announced as early as possible. 
                                However, sometimes we have trouble reserving rooms and are forced to give quick notice. 
                                Make certain you are subscribed to the lug-members mailing list to recieve information about upcoming meetings.
                            </p>

                                If you have questions about the LUG organization, projects, meeting times, etc., please email any of the officers. 
                                We will be happy to converse with anyone interested in Linux, or coming to our meetings.
