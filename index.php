                            <p>
                                We serve Linux users who live in or around the small state of Delaware, as well as the University of Delaware Newark campus. 
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                All Linux users are welcome to our meetings and mailing lists regardless of experience or skill. 
                                Please see below to find out how to come to our meetings.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                LUG is a Registered Student Organization of the University of Delaware, and as such, officers are undergraduate and graduate students of UD. 
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                This does not, however, mean we close our doors to those outside the university. 
                                In fact, most of our membership are not students, but live in the surrounding community.
                            </p>

                                To join LUG, simply come to the meetings or converse with others on the mailing lists. 
                                If you would like to become an officer, get involved in projects and show interest in helping the organization.

                                Anyone interested in presenting on any topic is encouraged to email the president (see Additional Information) or ask at a meeting.
